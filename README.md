# hi.

this is my first thing on github.  
i don’t fully know what i’m doing yet, but i’m here anyway.

## what is this?
honestly? a start.  
some code, some experiments, some “why did i do it this way” moments.

## what to expect
- things that work (eventually)
- things that don’t
- comments like “fix later” that i may or may not come back to
- learning in public, which is slightly terrifying


## why github?
because hiding drafts forever doesn’t teach you anything.  
and everyone starts somewhere, even if their first commit is a mess.

## rules (for now)
1. keep going
2. don’t delete progress just because it’s awkward
3. try to understand yesterday’s code tomorrow

if you’re reading this: hi.  
if you’re future me: be nice.
